                Exclusion, to feel or be outside, is about not having a connection to the rest of society. 
                We can say that feeling alienated is the opposite of feeling community. 
                There can be several different reasons why someone falls outside the rest of society.
                 For some, this is about lack of participation in education or work. 
                 Others may fall outside due to language challenges or a different culture than the majority. 
                 There is a high level of outdoor activity among young people in Norway

            <p>
                There are many young people who feel left out,
                 because they do not have someone to talk to or someone to be with in their spare time.
                 In order for us to have a society that takes it's people into account and has positive thoughts, 
                 it is very important to take action
                 and take care our young people and try hard to get them to include themselves in the social community. 
                 It is very important that older people prevent exclusion in
                 among young ones.

                This summer, the organization Young Inclusion held a team building project, 
                where all the young people got to talk about their thoughts and get involved to make a difference.
                   everyone had to write things down so they could write down the ideas. this went very well and everyone enjoyed it.
                    The organization invited 30 participants who were both majorities and minorities.

            <p>
                In the team building project, people decided to side activities and everyone in the team agreed to play ball games,
                 One of the ball games that everyone enjoyed the most was most volleyball.
                 Volleyball is a game that requires cooperation and motivation from each other in the team.
                 After the game was over, people had an evaluation of how it went and all the results were much better than expected.

                All participants had the opportunity to participate in many different activities and all received good food and drink. 
                Some wanted to grill food because they liked grilling and this was an opportunity to match together to those who had common interests. 
                This group was very kind and decent and they decided to share the food with the rest of the others who could not grill and taught them a little how to grill.

                The ending was very good. the organization did research and asked all participants what was good and what was not good. 
                Most had positive return messages. Everyone has made at least one friend through this project. 
                Many of the participants wanted to participate in the next projects to come. And finally, everyone joined a group photo.
