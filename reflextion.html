    <p>
        Throughout this work we made it hard for ourselves by making the wireframe first and code after. 
        We have made wireframe with many sides, but we had to switch to one that suits both.
        We found out that the best way for us was to code first, then do the wireframe after. 
        However, we had to be creative on both wireframe and the actual page. 
        How to separate the header and footer from the main, was maybe the most challenging coding our project.
        We have done everything right, but the headers and footers do not want to be separated. 
        It was hard to see where the mistakes were made. 
        We spent sometimes to find typos, which were for instance 100px instead of 100%.
        It was hard to fill in the spaces we have when it is bigger size screen.
        We thought that it would have been a better page if we fill in the horizontal spaces. 
        It was not very easy to make the exact same page as the wireframe. 
        We have used the +scrset attribute because it allows us to define different types of images. 
        Another reason, it helps to specifies the pictures or images sizes in different sizes of screen.

        When it comes to photos, we used photos found it from the website because no one in our group had photos they took this summer, 
        most of the photos we took this summer were personal photos and we could'nt use them. 
        In the end we decided to use photos from the internet, 
        since the most important thing was not the photos, but being able to use photos.
